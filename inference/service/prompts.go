// GenerateReportContentPrompt generates a prompt for generating or regenerating a report section based on the SOAP architecture.
// It takes the transcribed audio, the specific SOAP section (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Planning), the desired style,
// any updates to be incorporated, and the previously generated content (if any).
//
// Parameters:
// - transcribedAudio: The transcribed audio text to be used for generating the report content.
// - soapSection: The specific section of the SOAP report to be generated (e.g., Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Planning).
// - style: The desired writing style for the generated content.
// - updates: BSON document containing updates to be incorporated into the regenerated content.
// - content: The previously generated content for the specified SOAP section.
//
// Returns:
// - A string containing the generated prompt for the AI medical assistant to generate or regenerate the report content.
